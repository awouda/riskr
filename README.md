Riskr
====

A clone of Risk(tm). A case study for experimenting with actors, akka, spray and real-time distributed computing.

Setup
----

This use case has been setup using the following steps:

  1) Install sbt 0.13
  
  2) Find a set of compatible dependencies: scala 1.10.2 and akka 2.2.0

Branching
----
A new branch will be produced each time a milestone is achieved.

The goals of each milestone will be described in the the wiki

Directory structure
----
The structure of the project follows closely (but not exactly) the specification for maven. 

To keep the design modular, the design will be split in sub-modules.
